We, as a society, hold beliefs about science that may be romanticized and inaccurate. 
These ideas can be exclusionary in the way we define a typical scientist and how science is done. 
These notions about science can also become obstacles for us as a community to perform rigorous, 
inclusive and useful science, impede us individually in our professional growth, 
by contributing to unrealistic self-expectations (and therefore poor mental health), 
and hinder our ability to build supportive academic communities. 
We hope that these materials will provide you with a starting point to build a more accurate conception of science.


## Skill Building

In addition to developing technical skills, 
there are many equally important soft-skills you will learn as a PhD student -- 
skills like reading research papers, communicating at group meetings, 
writing research papers and rebuttals, and time management. 
Although you will likely have worked on similar skills throughout your academic and professional life so far, 
you may find that adapting the skills you already have to fit the needs of your PhD program is challenging. 
The resources below will help you get started. 
We hope that in going through them, you can shift your focus from outcome to process: 
you’re a PhD student and here to learn -- it wouldn’t make sense if you already knew how to do everything!

  1. What should you expect from yourself in your first year?
  2. What does your advisor expect from you in your first year?
  3. How can you be supportive of your peers?
