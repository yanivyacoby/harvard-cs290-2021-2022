Good communication practices in collaborative environments are vital. 
Whether in group meetings, 1-on-1s with your advisor / collaborators, 
spontaneous blackboard brainstorming sessions, good communication practices will help you get you unstuck, 
come up with new directions, as well as get clearer and more structured feedback on your work, etc. 
As such, it is important to stay organized and be proactive about soliciting feedback from your collaborators. 
In this tutorial, we provide (a) general tips about how to run meetings, 
and (b) a step-by-step template for running your meetings to get you started.

## General Tips

1. **Summarize** the project’s current state and goals succinctly. Your collaborators, including your advisor, may be quite busy and involved in a large number of projects, and may therefore **not remember** exactly where you left off the last time you chatted, and may not remember the smaller details of your project. 
2. Before presenting results, always provide a **high-level synthesis** of the results. 
  * For **empirical** work, for example, never simply show a figure and start discussing its content -- first explain the figure at a **high-level**, as well as its **significance**, then explain how to read the figure (e.g. what’s on each axis, and if this is a benchmark, what "good performance" looks like), and only then get into the details. 
  * For **theoretical** work, remind your collaborators about notation, the theorem statement (or idea towards a theorem), and where the discussion had got to last time. As with empirical work, refresh context before jumping into new ideas or results. 
3. **Before a meeting**, you may find it useful to send notes summarizing what you’ll be discussing in the meeting and what feedback you would like (you can follow the step-by-step template below). This can help give your collaborators **more time to think** about your project and give you more meaningful feedback.
  * **Tip:** google docs and google slides make it easy to share notes and figures. For sharing more math-heavy notes, consider using something like hackmd.io, which allows you to mix markdown with LaTex.  
4. **After a meeting**, message all of your collaborators with the **agreed-upon** next steps to make sure everyone is on the same page.
