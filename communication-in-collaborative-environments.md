Good communication practices in collaborative environments are vital. 
Whether in group meetings, 1-on-1s with your advisor / collaborators, 
spontaneous blackboard brainstorming sessions, good communication practices will help you get you unstuck, 
come up with new directions, as well as get clearer and more structured feedback on your work, etc. 
As such, it is important to stay organized and be proactive about soliciting feedback from your collaborators. 

In this guide, we provide (a) general tips about how to run meetings, 
and (b) a step-by-step template for running your meetings to get you started.


## General Tips

1. **Summarize** the project’s current state and goals succinctly. Your collaborators, including your advisor, may be quite busy and involved in a large number of projects, and may therefore **not remember** exactly where you left off the last time you chatted, and may not remember the smaller details of your project. 
2. Before presenting results, always provide a **high-level synthesis** of the results. 
  * For **empirical** work, for example, never simply show a figure and start discussing its content -- first explain the figure at a **high-level**, as well as its **significance**, then explain how to read the figure (e.g. what’s on each axis, and if this is a benchmark, what "good performance" looks like), and only then get into the details. 
  * For **theoretical** work, remind your collaborators about notation, the theorem statement (or idea towards a theorem), and where the discussion had got to last time. As with empirical work, refresh context before jumping into new ideas or results. 
3. **Before the meeting**, you may find it useful to send notes summarizing what you’ll be discussing in the meeting and what feedback you would like (you can follow the step-by-step template below). This can help give your collaborators **more time to think** about your project and give you more meaningful feedback.
  * **Tip:** Having visual aids for the meeting can be incredibly helpful. Google docs and google slides make it easy to share notes and figures. For sharing more math-heavy notes, consider using something like hackmd.io, which allows you to mix markdown with LaTeX. By using one of these collaborative online tools, your collaborators can also leave you comments as they look through your meeting materials.  
4. **After the meeting**, message all of your collaborators with the **agreed-upon** next steps to make sure everyone is on the same page.  


## Step-by-Step Template for Running Your Meeting

### **Step 1:** Outline

* Start by **outlining** what you will be discussing in this meeting, as well as what **feedback** you are specifically hoping to get from your collaborators.
* Your meeting-time can be used in a variety of ways -- unstructured thinking (e.g. formulating a research question, coming up with new projects or directions), active work on trying to make progress (e.g. debugging, diagnosing strange results, sketching a proof idea, designing an experiment), discussing a relevant paper you all read, soliciting feedback on writing, etc. -- just be clear from the start what the goal of the meeting is.
> **Tip:** If giving an update on progress you've made since the last meeting, you can use language like, "In this meeting, I was hoping to discuss three things: \_\_\_\_. I would really appreciate your feedback on \_\_\_\_. Before I recap the progress we've made so far, does that sound good to everyone? and is there anything else that folks would like to discuss?"

### **Step 2:** Summarize

* Very briefly, **summarize** the overall goal of the project, and what you’ve done until the previous meeting. Although presumably your collaborators know and remember the overall goal, research goals may **naturally change** during the course of the project, so it’s important to keep everyone on the same page.

### **Step 3:** Provide Context

* In more detail, summarize **what** you agreed you would work on in the last meeting, and **why** what you agreed on was necessary. 
> **Tip:** use language like, "In our last meeting, we agreed that the best immediate next steps for the project are \_\_\_\_, since they will allow us to test our hypothesis that \_\_\_\_. This is what I’ve been investigating since our last meeting (Or, I went in a different direction, because \_\_\_\_)."

### **Step 4:** Dive in

* Once you’ve set the stage, dive into the update! If you are looking to share results in this meeting, be sure to give a **high-level synthesis** before delving into the details, and summarize the results again after presenting the details. 
* If you're looking to brainstorm, solicit feedback on writing, discuss a paper, list the questions / topics you want to discuss. 

### **Step 5:** Next Steps

* After you’ve given your update and solicited feedback from your collaborators, be sure to discuss **next steps**. 
* Lastly, before the meeting ends, **summarize** the next steps agreed on. This will help **prevent miscommunication**. 
> **Tip:** use language like, "Based on your feedback, it sounds like the next priority items on my agenda are \_\_\_\_. Does that sound good to everyone?".
