**Before class:**
* Review the guide about [how to read a research paper](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-read-a-research-paper/).
* Spend one hour reading and trying to get as much as you can out of the paper, [The Complexity of Gradient Descent: CLS = PPAD âˆ© PLS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01929.pdf). Note that the paper is far too long to read entirely in one hour; use strategies like those from the paper-reading guide to figure out where to focus your attention and try to get as much value as you can in the hour.
* Answer [these questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa3N2cXE2TJZxfqcqEjtEcAsbC3V2lFOyVXIiNJgRjLKx9XQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by 8pm the night before.

**In class:**
* Guest: [Professor Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/)
* Learn and practice how to read a theoretical CS paper
