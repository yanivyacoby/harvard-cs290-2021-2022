**Before class:** 
* From Harvard’s Report from the [Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health](https://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/report_of_the_task_force_on_managing_student_mental_health.pdf), read:
  * Page 18
  * Pick two subsections to read from from pages 19-25 -- one that feels possibly related to your experience so far, and one that feels unrelated
* Read pages 1-10 of: [Dealing with Social Isolation to Minimize Doctoral Attrition – A Four Stage Framework](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190398024.pdf). (Note: the words competent/incompetent in the article are technical jargon from the learning and cognition literature. As such, you should not interpret them using their colloquial meanings; we instead encourage you to think of these terms more as novice/expert).
* Answer [these questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZL8OJKyM1bzMihPinIQxnDm3w0hryaZOPENWs1BcrouZRWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by 8pm the night before.

**In class:**
* Guest: [Danielle Farrell](https://gsas.harvard.edu/person/danielle-farrell), the Director of Student Services
* Special note: no faculty present
* Discussion of readings, how to support peers, how to create a web of support
