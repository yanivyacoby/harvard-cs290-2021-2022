**Before class:** In this class we will discuss and practice how to update your advisor / collaborators on recent progress. Please come to class with a topic in mind -- a project (e.g. current or past research project, a hobbie, etc.) that you have worked on but haven't yet completed. The topic should be reasonably technical (your fellow classmates should only have a partial prior understanding of the topic).

**In class:** [How to communicate about weekly progress with your collaborators](/harvard-cs290/materials/communication-in-collaborative-environments)
