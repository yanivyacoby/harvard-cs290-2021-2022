**About:** 
Reading research papers is challenging; research papers are often dense, assuming significant prior knowledge about the field and about related work. 
As such, it is important to
1. expect that it will be a **learning process** -- that it might take a while at first, but with practice you will improve! and
2. to adopt and practice paper-reading strategies.

This tutorial consists of several parts:
1. General tips about paper-reading
2. A specific

## General Tips for Paper Reading

### Research papers are **not** meant to be read top-to-bottom, like a book. 
* We recommend **first skimming** the paper (see "how to skim a research paper" below), focusing on the **high-level ideas**, and jotting down high-level questions you may have about the **story** told by the paper.
* Then, if the paper seems relevant, you can give it a **deeper read**. 
* If you notice yourself getting confused, you are likely missing information that the paper assumes is known by the intended research community / audience. This is a good time to start reading bits and pieces of other resources to try to **fill in the gap**. These include related papers (e.g. ones cited by the paper you’re reading, ones that share key-terms on google), wikipedia pages, blog-posts, lectures on youtube, etc. -- find a resource that seems helpful and give it a try! There’s no formula here, but going back and forth between reading related material and the original paper of interest can help you get unstuck.

### Stay organized -- keep track of what you’ve already read:
* Reading research papers is challenging -- save your future-self time and take notes that will help you dig deeper every time you re-visit the paper. 
* Different people find different organizational methods useful, but some common ones are:
  - Taking notes on the paper, underlining, without focus on being neat -- this can help you understand the paper better as you go!
  - Keeping a **searchable doc** online (e.g. Evernote) in which you summarize the paper / answer the paper-reading questions below -- this will help you pick up a paper where you left off.
  - Using a **citation manager** (e.g. Zotero) to keep lists of paper and easily create latex bibliographies -- this will save you time when writing your own paper.
* For every paper, especially focus on recording:
  - The “big ideas”
  - Relevant buzz words
  - Story / narrative (consisting of the answers to the questions listed below)

### Ask lots and lots of questions:
* You’re here to **learn** how to read papers and are *not expected to already know how to do it*.
* Reading research papers is challenging: they are often very dense and assume significant prior knowledge about the field and about related work. It is important to ask questions about the paper you read, and actively look for tips about others’ paper-reading strategies! 
* It is expected and normal that when you first start reading research papers in a new field, it will take you several hours to get through a paper. 


## How to Read a Research Paper

### What kind of paper are you reading? 
* Big idea 
* Unifying theme 
* Small idea with evaluation (most papers)
* Measurement
* Comparison
* Retrospective or experience paper

### Motivation and Potential Impact 
* What is the problem the paper addresses?
* Why is this problem important?
* Related Work and Contributions 
* How is the problem traditionally solved?
* Why are existing approaches not good enough?
* At a high level, how does the paper address the problem?

### Results (Theory and/or Experiments)
* Theory
  - What are the main theorems in the paper?
  - Is there a new proof technique?
  - At a high level, how do the theorems relate to earlier results?
* Experiments
  - How does the paper define success?
  - How is success measured?
  - What approaches does the paper compare against (and why?)
  - At a high level, what are the results?

### Broader Impact
* Identify the relevant socio-technical systems
  - Where could the technology be deployed, or which kind of technology is informed by the paper (if a theoretical paper)?
  - How would this technology be used?
* Identify the stakeholders
  - Who would be the users?
  - Who would be the affected communities (are these the users)?
* What types of good can this technology do?
  - What kinds of needs do these users/businesses/communities have?
  - What kinds of constraints do these users/businesses/communities have?
* What types of harm can this technology do?
  - What kinds of failures can this technology have?
  - What kinds of direct harm can these failures cause?
  - What kinds of harm can be caused by the broader, socio-technical system?

### What questions do you have? 
For example,
* What “holes” are there in your understanding of the paper’s narrative? (e.g. the paper claims that traditional methods cannot solve the problem, but you don’t see why they don’t suffice? The paper claims the problem is important, but you don’t see why?, etc.)
* What are unfamiliar terms used in the paper that seem important?
