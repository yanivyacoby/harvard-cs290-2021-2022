## Course Description

This course is designed for entering computer science Ph.D. students. 
The goals of the course are three-fold: 
1. to introduce students to research around the CS area, 
2. skills building, and 
3. cohort building. 

We will lead sessions on skill building (paper reading, presentation, meaning of research) 
and soft skill building (advising relationships, academic culture, mental health, supporting your peers), 
as well as research and professional oriented discussions with a broad mixture of CS faculty members. 
We will also "visit" and discuss one or two CS colloquia. 

This is a full-year, 4-unit course, meeting once a week in each of the fall and the spring. 
Students must complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year to receive credit.
